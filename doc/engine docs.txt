acceleration factor function
---------------------------- 
equation: (-2/3 * ( .5w + w^5 )) + 1
where w = weight/50 - 1

.5 scales the rate at which acceleration increases within the normal range of weights (25 - 75)
whereas the exponent scales the rate at the extreme edges.
Low and high weights are rare (following a normal distribution) so they scale sharply with rarity

the 2/3 scales the range into 1 to -1 for the output function and the plus 1 sets the range to 2 to 0.

to change these weights, for the scalar, do whatever and then the normalizer n (the 2/3 component) will be
         1
n = ----------
    scalar + 1

the exponent needs to be odd. large exponents create a sharper cutoff (less range, steeper slope).


thoughts
---------
implement "inertia" so that when heavy/slow snails are slowed down its not as severe a punishment
play around with concept of "tanks"
fast snails are affected a lot by kinitec energy loss
maybe slow snails have extra ability roll


winning:
so when winning getting all snails is too brutal
instead you get to pick one to steal from the roster of losers
this disincentives people running multiple snails per race from different wallets
instead of getting all of them now its more like "trading up"

add "Volatility"
speed: "throw rod" failure
       function of weight (low weight high volatitity)
ability: "hurt itself in confusion" failure
         function of weight (high weight high Volatility1)
