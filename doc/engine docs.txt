acceleration factor function: (-2/3 * ( .5w + w^5 )) + 1
where w = weight/50 - 1

.5 scales the rate at which acceleration increases within the normal range of weights (25 - 75)
whereas the exponent scales the rate at the extreme edges.
Low and high weights are rare (following a normal distribution) so they scale sharply with rarity

the 2/3 scales the range into 1 to -1 for the output function and the plus 1 sets the range to 2 to 0.

to change these weights, for the scalar, do whatever and then the normalizer n (the 2/3 component) will be
         1
n = ----------
    scalar + 1

the exponent needs to be odd. large exponents create a sharper cutoff (less range, steeper slope).
