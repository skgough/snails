# snails
This was an idea for a racing/chance game where you spend money to get snails (racers) that have attributes at various levels of rarity. Some attributes could help you win and others could make you spontaneously explode. Others just looked cool.

I made a gui to quickly iterate on parameters to make the game more enjoyable but I think I got carried away on its design tbh. There's also a frontend prototype for the marketplace where you would trade snails. I didn't want to decide on an aesthetic yet so I left the css at just layout level (in other words don't @ me coz its ugly).
